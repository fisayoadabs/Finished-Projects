# School Enrollment Statistics

This project is designed to analyze and visualize school enrollment statistics for a given set of data. It imports data from three different CSV files representing school enrollment data for the years 2018-2019, 2019-2020, and 2020-2021. The code allows users to input a school name or code and retrieves enrollment information for that specific school.

## Instructions

1. Ensure that the CSV files containing the school enrollment data are present in the same directory as this code file. The file names are:
   - SchoolData_2018-2019.csv
   - SchoolData_2019-2020.csv
   - SchoolData_2020-2021.csv

2. Run the code.

3. The program will display the prompt "Please enter a high school name or the school code." Enter the name or code of the school you want to retrieve enrollment statistics for. The code validates the input and displays an error message if the input is invalid.

4. Once a valid input is provided, the program will display the requested school's name and code, along with enrollment statistics.

5. Additionally, the program generates two sets of graphs:
   - The first set shows scatter plots of the school's enrollment in grade 10, 11, and 12 for the years 2018-2019, 2019-2020, and 2020-2021.
   - The second set includes three line plots for grade 10, 11, and 12 enrollment over the years 2019, 2020, and 2021.

6. Review the enrollment statistics and graphs to gain insights into the school's enrollment trends over the years.

**Note:** The code utilizes the NumPy and Matplotlib libraries, which should be installed for proper execution.

*This code was created as part of the ENDG 233 course.*
